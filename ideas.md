# Transparency in Inductive Program Synthesis
- where in the hypothesis space is the system getting hung up, or skipping over, so we could provide full input-output examples or input-output examples for subproblems
- what each grammar + witness functions can and cannot describe
- interactive dsl design?
- Are you teaching the PBE system a concept you want it to just know? Create a new primitive? (text → more nuanced parsing, say, of nested expressions)
- currently, system is still teaching me by example (not very well) about what it can and cannot learn
- hard to change my mind and redefine labels
- inferring negative examples from absent labels in sequences gets tricky when the computer wipes away some of those labels between others during an update
